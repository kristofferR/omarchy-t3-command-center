# Third-party notices

## T3 Code

The bridge reuses selected source modules from T3 Code through the ignored
`upstream/t3code` source checkout. `lib/runtime-build.json` records the source
commit used for the bundled marketplace executable. The vector path in `qml/T3Mark.qml` is also
derived from that revision.

packaged artifacts as `licenses/T3-CODE-LICENSE`.

## Bundled Node.js runtime and JavaScript dependencies

Standalone / marketplace artifacts embed Node.js and bundled JavaScript
dependencies. Packaging discovers those dependencies from the generated source
map and ships their exact notices under `licenses/`, with versions and
filenames listed in `licenses/BUNDLED-LICENSES.json`. Node's complete runtime
notice (including its bundled third-party notices) is shipped as
`licenses/NODEJS-LICENSE`.
